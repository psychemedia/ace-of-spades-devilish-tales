# The Devil's Prayer Book

A phrase I heard Eddie Lenihan use to describe a pack of cards, but I can't remember the story he was telling at the time.

So in the meantime, here are some storynotes on related themes, such as a pack of playing cards being Jack's, or a soldier's, prayer book, and various tales that involve cardgames with the devil. A brief bibliography of relating to the history of playing cards is also provided, lest those works provide additional tales.

The History Of Playing Cards, In Conjuring, Fortune Telling & Card Sharping*, E. S. Taylor, 1865, pp.442-5


No history of card-playing would be complete without the well known fragment of popular ingenuity called “ Cards Spiritualized; or, the Soldier's Almanac, Bible, and Prayer Book," which, in the form of a half-penny broad-sheet, is still circulated among the poorer classes of our population.

“ RICHARD MIDDLETON, a soldier, attending divine serXli vice, with the rest of the regiment at a church in Glasgow, instead of pulling out a Bible, like his brother soldiers, to find the parson’s text, spread a pack of cards before him. This singular behaviour did not long pass unnoticed, both by the clergyman and the serjeant of the company to which he belonged; the latter in particular requested him to put up the cards, and on his refusal, conducted him after church before the Mayor, to whom he preferred a formal complaint of Bichard’s indecent behaviour during divine service. ‘Well, soldier!* (said the Mayor) ‘what excuse have you for this strange scandalous behaviour ? If you can make any apology, or assign any reason for it, it’s well; if you cannot, assure yourself that I will cause you, without delay, to be severely punished for it.* * Since your honour is so good,* replied Richard, * I will inform you. I have been eight days on march, with a bare allowance of six-pence a day, which your honour will surely allow is hardly sufficient to maintain a man in meat, drink, washing, and other necessaries that consequently he may want, without a Bible, Prayer Book, or any other good book.* On saying this, Richard drew out his pack of cards, and presenting one of the aces to the Mayor, continued his address to the magistrate as follows :

“ ‘ When I see an Ace, may it please your honour, it reminds me that there is only one God ; and when I look upon a Two or a Three, the former puts me in mind of the Father and Son, and the latter of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. A Four calls for remembrance the Four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. A Five, the five wise Virgins who were ordered to trim their lamps; there were ten, indeed, but five, your worship may remember, were wise, and five were foolish. A Six, that in six days God created heaven and earth. A Seven, that on the seventh day he rested from all that he had made. An Eight, of the eight righteous persons preserved from the deluge: viz., Noah and his wife, with his three sons and their wives. A Nine, of the nine lepers cleansed by our Saviour; there were ten, but one only returned to offer his tribute of thanks. And a Ten, of the ten commandments that God gave Moses on Mount Sinai, on the two tables of stone.’ He took the Knave and put it aside. ‘ When I see the Queen, it puts me in mind of the Queen of Sheba, who came from the furthermost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon, for she was as wise a woman as he a man, for she brought fifty boys and fifty girls, all clothed in girls’ apparel to shew before King Solomon, for him to test which were boys and which were girls,—but he could not until he called for water to wash themselves; the girls washed up to their elbows, and the boys only up to the wrists of their hands, so King Solomon told by that. And when I see the King, it puts me in mind of the Great King of Heaven and Earth, which is God Almighty; and likewise his Majesty Kin g George the Fourth, to pray for him.* ‘ Well,’ said the Mayor, ‘you have given a good description of all the cards except one, which is lacking.’ ‘ Which is that ?’ said the soldier. * The Knave,* said the Mayor.

“ * If your honour will not be angry with me,* returned Richard, * I can give you the same satisfaction on that as any in the pack ? * * No,* said the Mayor. * Well,* returned the sol¬ dier, * the greatest knave that I know is the serjeant who brought me before you.* * I don’t know,* replied the Mayor, * whether he be the greatest knave or no j but I am sure he is the greatest fooL*

“ The soldier then continued as follows: * When I count the number of dots in a pack of cards, there are 365,—so many days as there are in a year. W r lien I count how many cards are in a pack, I find there are 52,—so many weeks are there in a year. When I reckon how many tricks are won by a pack, I find there are 13,—so many months are there in a year. So that this pack of cards is both Bible, Almanack, and Prayer Book to me.*

“ The Mayor called his servants, ordered them to entertain the soldier well, gave him a piece of money, and said he was the cleverest fellow he ever heard in his life.**

This amusing sketch, in the copy from which it is transcribed, is surrounded by rude cuts of a suit of cards, in black, and was printed at New¬ castle.

...

In another chap-book, entitled A new Game of Cards, between a Nobleman in London and one of his Servants, we find a variation of this story. The servant, denounced as a gambler, denies the charge ; a pack of cards is found in his pocket, and he defends himself similarly by stratagem. He is reminded of his allegiance by the King and Queen; the Ten is the ten commandments ; Nine refers to the nine muses; the Eight, of the eight altitudes, and the eight saved in the ark; the Seven, of the seven wonders of the world, and the seven planets ; the Six, of the six petitions in the Lord’s Prayer; the Five, of the five senses; the Four, of the four seasons; the Three, of the three graces, and the three days and nights Jonah was in the whale’s belly; the Two, of the two Testaments, and the two contrary principles, virtue and vice ; and the Ace, of the worship of the One God. The knave is the per¬ son who informed against him.

There are several synonyms of this story, but it is scarcely necessary, from their obvious sameness, to quote them.

"Search him and you will find the cards in his pocket." Jack was searched and the cards was got in his pockets and the gentleman began to stamp in passion about the room. Saying "how dare you, you impudent rogue, you seeing you are guilty what right had you to deny it, and I would freely forgive you, but now I will condemn you with the utmost severity, not because you are a gambler, but because you are a liar also." Why my lord I hope you won't condemn me of what I am not guilty of. "Why you villain you, what stronger evidence than the cards is to be got in your pocket." "If you call them cards I don't neither tdo I use them." "Them is my Almanac." "Almanac you Villain you; no one ever made an Almanac of a pack of cards." Why my lord, I am no scholar I can neither read or write and these anser my purpose to rule and govern the year by." "If so Jack let me hear it and if I find you convert[?] your cards exceedingly well, I will not be in the least angry with you but I will freely forgive you. " "There are four suits in the cards that intimate to me the four seasons of the year. There are thirteen cards in each suit and that is the exact number of weeks in a quarter. There is as many [limitations?] in the year as there are cards in the suit. There is 365 spots on a pack of cards and that is the exact number of days in a year. Then I multiply by [?] and 60 and I bring out the exact number of minutes in the year." "Pray Jack do you make any further use of them." "Yes my lord a good deal." "What further use do you make of them."

"I sometimes make a Prayer Book of them." "Well if you make a Almanac of them you could never make a prayer book of them." "Well my lord I told I was no scholar that I could neither read or write and those answers my purpose as well as the best prayer book in the city of London." "If so Jack let me hear it, for I like the beginning very well." "These are the four suits in the cards that intimates to me the four Principal Religions that is prominent in this world Christians, Judaism, Mahommedism, Manpaganism, When I look upon the ten it puts me in mind of the ten Plague of Egypt which God had afflicted on the Egyptians when he sent the children of Israel out of the land the two cities of Sodom and Gomorrah that were burned with Brimestone from heaven and the ten commandments of God and the ten tribes of Israel that were cut off for their wickedness. When I look upon the nine it puts me in mind of nine Ironicals[?] the nine noble orders amongst men. When I look upon the eight Beatitudes the eight attitudes the eight [p?] mentioned in Scripture that were released from death to life. When I look upon the seven it puts me in mind of the seven Administriating Spirits that stand before the throne of God the seven seals in which the book of life is sealed by the seven vials filled with the indignation of the world the seven liberal arts of Science, the seven wonders of the world, the seven planets that rule the seven days of the week. When I look upon the six it puts me in mind of the Petitions containing

the Lords Prayer, the six days we have to work our bread and keep the seventh day Holy. When I look upon the five it puts me in mind of the Senses given by God to man, that is Hearing, Seeing, Tasting, Touching, and smelling. When I look upon the four it puts me in mind of the four everlasting things, Death, Judgement, Hell and Heaven, the four seasons God has divided for the use of man that is Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. When I look upon the three it puts me in mind of the three District Persons equal and coequal the three days our Saviour hung struggling on the cross for the redemption of Mankind, and the three days he laid interred in the bowels of the earth. When I look upon the two it puts me in mind of the two testaments the old and the new, the two contrary principles struggling in man that is vice, and virtue. When I look upon the one it puts me in mind that I have only one God to adore and serve, one truth to practice, one Baptism that cleanses me from Original Sin, and one , one only master to serve and obey." "If so Jack when you are shuffling your cards you passed from the King to the ten and laid by the Knave." "Did it put you in mind of anything." "I had very lightly[?] to forget." "It put me in mind of your Lordship." How dare you count me a Knave before my face." "You have misapprehended me, I meant your lordships informer." "If so Jack it is pretty well turned." He preferred Jack to the highest place in his service, doubled his wages and discharged the man who told the story.

AT1613: “Playing‑Cards Are my Calendar and Prayerbook.”

The Mysteries of a Pack of Cards

A private soldier was taken before a magistrate recently for playing cards during Devine Service. A sergeant commanded the soldiers at church. When the parson had read the prayers he took the text. Those who had a bible followed the text, but this soldier had neither Bible nor prayer book. Taking out a pack of cards he placed them before him. He looked at one card after another. The sergeant saw him and said "Put up the cards, this is no place for them." "Never mind," said the private. After the service the culprit was brought before a magistrate. "What is the charge against this soldier?" asked the magistrate. "Playing cards in church". "What have you to say for yourself." the culprit was asked. "Much, sir, I hope." "Very good," said the magistrate. If not you will be punished severely".
"I have been six weeks on the march. I have neither bible nor prayer book. I have nothing but a pack of cards, and I'll satisfy your worship with the purity of my intentions." Spreading the cards before him he began: "When I see the ace it reminds me that there is but one true God. The Deuce reminds me of the Father & Son: The Trey reminds me of the Blessed Trinity: The Four spot of the Four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke & John. The Five reminds me of the five wounds of Our Lord: the Six indicates the six days in which God made the world: the Seven tells me that He rested on the seventh day and made it holy: the Eight tells me of the 8 persons saved at the Deluge: the Nine reminds me of the Lepers who were healed: nine of the ten did not return to thank God. The Ten tells me of the Ten Commandments which God gave to Moses on the mountain. The "Jack of Clubs" is not honest: The other three Jacks are Christ's executioners.

The Queens represent the women who anointed Christ, and the Queen of Hearts, His Mother. When I see the Kings I think of God Almighty, King of Heaven, and the three Wise Kings of the East."
"Well" said the Mayor, "What have you to say of the Jack of Clubs?" "I will give an account of him, also, if you do not punish me," said the soldier. "Have no fear," said the Mayor. "The Jack of Clubs represents the traitor Judas, also the Knave who reported me". I also use the cards as an almanac, " said the soldier. "There are 365 spots corresponding to 365 days: 52 cards, the number of weeks: 4 suits the four seasons, and 12 court cards standing for the 12 months."

The Joker and a Pack of Cards

Post
One night one of the Murphy men from Kilkeel was going home, he had to pass a good many fields, between Killgarriff and his own home. He had a deck of playing cards in his pocket including the joker. When he was in third field and it was a lonely one when he noticed a bullock following him and the walls falling before him. The animal was nearly up to him when he thought of the joker which he had in his pocket, he pulled it out, and threw it away, and then the bullock stopped following, and the man got home safe. The devil is sometimes called the joker, and it is unlucky to carry the joker with you when you are out at night.

Once an Irishman went to Scotland. He was very fond of a game of cards but whenever he did so he was always guilty of some trickery. When he went to Confession and confessed that sin he never got Absolution.

One night the priest of the parish that the lad used to go to confession to was going on a sick call. He had to cross a river where a very narrow plank was laid. He was afraid to cross. Who was coming along from card playing but the lad. Well Pat said the priest will you carry me over this plank? I will said Pat if you give me Absolution. I will said the priest, on the other side. Pat was carrying the priest along and the priest said, "Were you card - playing tonight Pat"? I was said Pat 'why'? Well, the Devil is on you said the priest. If he is said Pat I'll soon shake him off me and he shook the priest into the river.

The Devil and the Gamblers

Share
Post
Outside Clifden there lived four great gamblers and the people used to say that they would sell their souls for a good game of cards and high stakes. They were warned by wise women to stop playing cards but the warning fell on deaf ears. To make it worse they used to stay out playing cards till dawn and then used to sleep all day.
One night when they were playing in a neighbour's house a hand came out from under a table and snapped the ace of spades out of one gambler's hand. He was a little frightened but saying nothing he played on. A wise old women told them that that was sign for them to quit the cards but they only laughed at her. This night or at least this morning when they were going home they met at a certain bridge, a man with a top hat on his head a deck of cards in his hand and a table in front of him. He invited the gamblers to have a game and thinking he was a neighbour they sat down for a few games. The man with the top hat kept winning and winning till at last the gamblers planked down their last fiver.
But it did not matter the man with the top hat won. Then one of the gamblers let fall the ace of spades and he put down his hand to pick it up. But when he looked under the table he nearly died with fright for he saw a cloven foot sticking from under the table. Then the others saw it and they ran for their lives. About a month after that they all died.

Long ago a man whose name is not known now was living at The Quay, Westport. He was always playing cards and he lost a lot of money. He always carried a pack of cards in his pocket.
One Sunday morning as he was going to mass he met a funny looking man on the road. The man had a little table and a pack of cards in his hand. He asked the man from The Quay, to play a game of cards with him. He agreed, and forgot all about mass. They began to play and were playing until late in the evening. The man from the Quay was losing all his money. At last he said, "With the help of God, I will win this game." As he said these words the other man disappeared. He was playing with the devil all the day. From that day onward he never played cards.

About one hundred years ago there lived in this parish a man named Patrick Kelly who used to be playing cards with other men every night.
One night he won all the money the others had. When he was on his way home he saw a man standing at the door of an old house.
He asked him to have a game of cards. He went in and when he was about two hours playing he let a card fall.
His companion told him to pick it up.
When he was picking it up he saw four legs on his companion. When he got up again he saw horns on him and fire coming out of his back.
When he saw this he ran out shouting "the devil is after me for being playing cards". He said he would never go out playing cards again.
The neighbours said the devil was in that house since the owners of it died about four years before that.

No. 63.— The Black Lady

A young girl goes to service at an old castle with the Black Lady, who warns her not to look through the window. The Black Lady goes out. The girl gets bored, looks through the window, and sees the Black Lady playing cards with the devil. She falls down frightened. The Black Lady comes in and asks her what she has seen. 'Nothing saw I; nought can I say. Leave me alone; I am weary of my life.' The Black Lady beats her, and asks her again, 'What saw you through the window?' 'Nothing saw I,' etc. The girl runs off and meets a keeper, who takes her home, and after some years marries her. She has a child, and is bedded. Enter the Black Lady. ' What saw you through the window ? ' ' Nothing saw I,' etc. The Black Lady takes the child, dashes its brains out, and exit. Enter the husband. The wife offers no explanation, and the husband wants to burn her, but his mother intercedes and saves her this time. But the same thing happens again, and the husband makes a fire. As she is being brought to the stake, the Black Lady comes. ' What saw you through the window?' 'Nothing saw I,' etc. 'Take her and burn her,' says the Black Lady. They fasten her up, and bring a light. The same question, the same answer. The Black Lady sees that she is secret, so gives her back her two children, and leaves her in peace.

```{admonition} *SSWANDA, THE PIPER*, Laboulaye's fairy book, 1866
:class: dropdown

In *Laboulaye's fairy book; fairy tales of all nations*, 1866, [p122-126](https://archive.org/details/cu31924051612137/page/n129/mode/2up):

SSWANDA, THE PIPER.

A BOHEMIAN TALE.

Sswanda, the Piper, was a jolly companion. Like every true musician, he was born with an unquenchable thirst ; be- sides, he was madly fond of play, and would have risked his soul at strajak, the favorite game at cards in Bohemia. When he had earned a little money, he would throw aside his pipes, and drink and play with the first comer till he returned to his home as light in pocket as when he had left it. But he was always so merry, witty, and good-natured that not a drinker ever left the table while the piper was there, and his name still lives in Bohemia as the prince of good fellows.

One day there was a festival at Mokran, and no merry- making was ever complete without the piper. Sswanda, after blowing his pipe till midnight and earning twenty zwanzigers, determined to amuse himself on his own account. Neither prayers nor promises could persuade him to go on with his music ; he was determined to drink his fill and to shuffle the cards at his ease ; but, for the first time in his life, he found no one to play with him.

Sswanda was not the man to quit the inn so long as he had a kreutzer in his pocket, and on that day he had many of them. By dint of talking, laughing, and drinking, he took one of those fixed ideas which are not uncommon among those who look too often in the bottom of their glass, and de- termined to play at any price ; but all his neighbors refused his challenge. Furious at finding no partner, he rose with an unsteady step, paid for what he had drank, and left the inn.

" I will go to Drazic," said he ; " the schoolmaster and the bailiff there are honest peo pie who are not afraid of play, and I shall find part ners. Hurrah !"

The night was clear, and the moon shone like a fish s eye. On reaching a cross road, Sswanda raised his eyes by chance, and stop ped mute and motionless A flock of ravens were croaking over his head, and in front of him rose four posts, standing like pillars, and connected at the top by cross-beams, from each of which swung a half de voured corpse. It was a robbers' gallows, a specta cle by no means amusmg to a less stoical spirit than that of Sswanda.

He had not recovered from the first shudder when suddenly there appeared before him a man dressed in black, with pale and hollow cheeks, and eyes that glittered like carbuncles.

" To Drazic, Mr. Black Coat," answered the intrepid Sswanda.

" Would you like to earn something by your music ?"

" I am tired of blowing,'' returned Sswanda. " I have some silver in my pocket, and wish to amuse myself."

" Who talks to you of silver ? It is with gold that we pay."

Saying this, the stranger flashed before his eyes a handful of shining ducats. The piper was the son of a thrifty moth- er ; he knew not how to resist such an invitation, and followed the black man and his gold.

How the time passed he never could remember. It is true that his head was a little heavy. The only thing that he rec- ollected was that the black man warned him to accept what- ever was offered him, whether gold or wine, but never to re- turn thanks except by saying " Good luck, brother !"

Without knowing how he had entered, he found himself in a dark room where three men, dressed in black like his guide, were playing at strajak by no other light than their glittering eyes. On the table were piles of gold, and a jug from which each one drank in his turn.

" Brothers," said the black man, " I bring you friend Sswan- da, whom you have long known by reputation. I thought to please you on this feast-day by giving you a little music."

" A good idea !" said one of the players. Then, taking the jug, he handed it to Sswanda, saying, " Here, piper, drink and play."

Sswanda had some scruples ; but, after all, it is impossible to have charcoal without putting your fingerp into the ashes. The wine, though rather warm, was not bad. He replaced the jug on the table, and, raising his hat, said, " Good luck, brother !" as he had been advised.

He began to play, and never had his music produced such an effect. Each note made the players leap for joy. Their eyes shot forth flames ; they moved about uneasily in their chairs ; they staked the ducats by handfuls ; they shouted and burst into loud fits of laughter without stirring a muscle of their palhd faces. The jug passed from hand to hand, always full, though replenished by no one.

As soon as Sswanda finished an air, they handed him the jug, from which he never failed to drink deeply, and threw handfuls of gold into his hat. " Good luck, brother !" he repeated, astounded at his fortune — " good luck !"

The feast lasted a long time. At last, the piper having struck up a polka, the black men, in a transport of mirth, quitted the table, and danced and waltzed with an ardor and frenzy which ill accorded with their icy faces. One of the dancers gathered up all the gold that was heaped on the table, and, pouring it into Sswanda's hat, " Here," said he, " take this for the pleasure that you have given us."

" God bless you, my good lords !" said the dazzled piper. Scarcely had he spoken when men, room, and cards vanished.

In the morning a peasant on his way to the fields heard the sound of a pipe as he approached the cross-road. " It is Sswanda," said he. But where was the piper ? Seated on a corner of the gallows, he was blowing with all his might, while the corpses of the robbers danced in the wind to his music.

" Halloo, comrade !" cried the peasant, " how long have you been playing the cuckoo up there ?"

Sswanda started, dropped his pipe, opened his eyes, and glided, bewildered, down the gallows. His first thought, however, was for his ducats. He rummaged Kis pockets, and turned his hat inside out, but all in vain ; there was not even a kreutzer !

" My friend," said the peasant, making the sign of the cross, " God has punished you by giving you the devil for a partner ; you love cards too well."

"Where are you going so late, friend Piper?" asked he, in a soft voice.

" You are right," said Sswanda, trembling ; " I will never touch them again in my life."

He kept his word ; and, to thank Heaven for having preserved him from such peril, he took the fatal pipe to which the devil had danced, and suspended it as a votive offering in the church of Strakonic, his birth-place, where it may be seen to this day. The pipe of Strakonic has become a proverb, and it is even said that its sound is heard every year at the day and hour when Sswanda played for Satan and his friends.
