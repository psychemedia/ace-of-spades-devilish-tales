<p>With the updated law of 1804, the commissioners of His Majesty’s Revenue were perhaps reinvigorated in their zeal to pursue potential felons as defined by the act, particularly as revenue from stamp duty on playing cards appeared to be falling off.</p>

Carlisle Journal - Saturday 23 March 1805</p>
<p>Police. —The Commissioners of the Stamp having discovered for a considerable time past a great falling off of the revenue, arising trom the taxation <em>of the Ace of Spades</em>, directed Mr Estcourt, their Solicitor, to endeavour to discover the cause, and he employed a number of men for that purpose; and it has been discovered that forged Aces of Spades, in Packs of Cards, have been circulated to an incredible number, particularly in the country. A number of their circulaters have been detected and apprehended, and have undergone several private examinations at the Public Office, Bow-street, before Mr Robinson. The particulars that transpired are, that they sold them under various pretences, and different prices, from 14s. to 24s. the dozen packs, and the venders of them by retail had found the sale of them to answer their purposes so well, that one in the country had given the forgers an order for an hundred dozen groce of packs. Yesterday several of them were fully committed for trial. It is a capital offence.</p>
</div>
<p>And so it was, that early in 1805, a certain Mr John Blacklin, along with two others, were arrested for selling packs of playing cards that included a forged Ace of Spades, thereby defrauding the King.</p>
<p>Three months later, at the end of April, 1805, they separately stood trial at the Old Bailey.</p>
<p>Blacklin was found guilty, but his legal representatives argued that the charge was mis-stated:</p>

Saint James’s Chronicle - Thursday 02 May 1805</p>
<p>_ OLD BAILEY—Monday, April 29.</p>
<p><em>John Blacklin</em> was indicted for feloniously vending playing cards, having a forged Ace of Spades. It appears that he sold the cards in packs of 51 each; and in another pack he delivered as many forged Aces of Spades. The duty on a pack of cards is 2s. 6d. but the prisoner sold his cards at 14s. per dozen packs. It was argued, that the cards thus disposed of could not be deemed complete packs; but this objection was over-ruled, and the prisoner was found guilty, but was recommended to mercy.</p>
<p>Tuesday, April 30.<br />
<em>Maydewall</em> and <em>Knype</em> were indicted for uttering forged stamps on the Ace of Spades, knowing them to be so. The fact of uttering was completely proved ; but the prisoners in their defence declared their ignorance of the forgery, which the Jury gave credit to by a verdict of acquittal.</p>

Ipswich Journal - Saturday 04 May 1805</p>
<p>Monday, at the Old Bailey, John Blacklin, of Queen-street, Cheapside was capitally convicted for vendings cards with a forged stamp (as an Ace of Spades.) The trial lasted 5 hours and a half. Two boys indicted with him were acquitted, having acted under his control. Blacklin is supposed to have gained 8000£ a year by this practice.</p>
</div>
<p>The two boys implicated in the case, Maydwell and Knype, were tried the following day. Another case tried that day, of a certain J. Harding (presumably no relation to a Mr. Harding we will meet later), a “dashing swindler”, sounds like a classic hustle…</p>

Old Bailey. [Yesterday]… J. Harding, a dashing swindler, who has sometimes called himself Lord Hawke, was tried on a capital indictment for stealing gold watch from a shop in Bond-street; but appearing that the shopkeeper’s apprentice had entrusted him with the watch, which he said he wished to shew to his brother, his depositing a fictitious bill for double the value, the capital part of the charge was done away, and was found guilty of simple felony.—J. Maydwell and J. Knype were tried for selling cards with a forged stamp of the ace of spades, in connection with Blacklin, capitally convicted on Monday: they declared their defence, that they thought the cards had been of French manufacture, and that they were engaged in a smuggling transaction only : the Jury gave them credit for this assertion, and they were accordingly acquitted.</p>

<p>OLD BAILEY.</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p><em>John Maydwell</em>, youth of 19, was indicted for selling and uttering cards with counterfeit stamps, knowing the same to be forged, with intent to defraud the Revenue. The Aces of Spades sold by, or found in the possession of the prisoner, were proved to be counterfeit by the same evidence yesterday adduced in the case of Blacklin.— The prisoner, in his defence, said, that he always understood the cards to have been imported from France, except the Aces of Spades, which, he believed, were procured from waste paper, purchased by the Neckinger Mill Company from the Stamp Office.— The Jury retired for a short time, and a returned a verdict of <em>Not Guilty</em>.</p>

<h2>The Trials of Maydwell and Knipe<a class="headerlink" href="#the-trials-of-maydwell-and-knipe" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Before we look at the case of John Blacklin, let’s see how the court heard the case be developed against the two young men, Maydwell and Knipe, who were accused of selling the cards that Blacklin had been found to have forged.</p>
<p>From the transcripts, it appears as if Maydwell had been selling incomplete packs of playing cards, and providing the Aces of Spades separately, working with Knipe in both the supply and delivery of the cards to a buyer working under the instructions of an officer from the Stamp Office.</p>
<p>After a purchase of a single pack for 2s, rather than the full, fair price, with duty, of 4s per pack. A further dozen packs, and then two dozen, with increasing discounts, were then purchased from Maydwell. The cards were passed off as French (i.e. smuggled) cards despite there being a maker’s stamp on them in the name of Hart, a card-manufacturer who had actually ceased trading several years previously, in November, 1794.</p>
<p>In the course of the evidence against Maydwell, two card makers, Edward Wright and Joseph Reynolds, admitted worked for a certain Mr Lee, who provided them with false stamps as well as procuring separate Aces from a source other then the Stamp Office.</p>

On the 8th of January last, I went to him at No. 6, Lovell’s-court, Paternoster-row; I told him that I was informed by a person that he dealt in cards; he said he did, but he had but one pack; he let me have them; they were put up in white paper, I gave him two shillings for them; there were fifty-two in the pack, and the ace of spades I think was with them; I saw him afterwards on the 11th at the same place, and I told him I wanted a dozen packs; he took me to a house in Butcherhall-lane, where he knocked at the door; a girl answered the door, and she asked him if his name was Isaac; he said, yes; he asked for a parcel that was left for him, and she gave him the parcel without any more questions.</p>
<p>Court. Q. Did you know what it contained? - A. Yes, a dozen packs of cards; he then delivered them to me, and I paid him twenty-three shillings for them; I told him I was going out of town at that time, and requested his directions, which he gave me, and it is now on the directions of one of the parcels.</p>
<p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look into that parcel, and see whether it is now as it was when it was delivered to you, and whether the aces of spades are not in a separate parcel to that? - A. Yes, it is; they correspond in number to them, but they are in separate parcels; I think I saw him again on the 17th in Lovell’s-court; I applied to him then for two packs; I then went with him again to Butcherhall-lane; he asked for Mr. Knipe; they said he was not there; then he said he must go to the office; he took me with him to the Bull and Mouth inn; he desired me to wait in the street; he went into the inn, and brought the two packs to me, all but the aces of spades; he said he must go and get the aces of spades; then I went with him to the house of Mr. Read, in Hosier-lane, a cloth-presser; after he had been in a little time, he called to me, while I was waiting in the street; I went in and paid him there two shillings a pack for them, and there I received the aces. On the 29th I saw him again in Lovell’s-court; he took me again to Butcherhall-lane, and there I saw Mr. Knipe; he asked for two packs of cards, and Mr. Knipe handed him out two parcels of cards, which he gave me. I saw him again on the 6th of February in Lovell’s-court; I applied for two dozen then; these are them.</p>
<p>Q. Are the aces of spades made up in a separate parcel, and correspond in number to the two dozen packs - open them? - A. Yes, they are; I paid him forty-five shillings for them; I saw they were in separate parcels after I got home; I had before observed the name of Hart being on the aces; I mentioned it to him; the reason of my observation to him was, because he had told me they were French cards; he told me that was an illusion, they were French cards.</p>
<p>Q. What may be the price of a pack of cards now, or at the time you bought these? - A. Four shillings a pack.</p>
<p>Court. Q. You mean the fair price with the duty? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Mr. Fielding. Q. In consequence of information, you went on purpose to purchase these cards? - A. Yes; I saw him again on the 16th of February, I went for two dozen; I went to the Bull and Mouth inn with him; I saw Knipe there; Maydwell said then he would get three dozen, and leave them with Mr. Knipe for me, as he was going out of town.</p>
<p>Q. He made an appointment with you on the 3d of March? - A. He was to meet me at the house of Mr. Pocock, No. 43, Eagle-street; I had told him that was my lodgings.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had not been acquainted with him prior to the month of January - it was only then that you were taken into this awkward service? - A. No.</p>
<p>Q. You depend upon the bounty of the Stamp-office? - A. No bounty at all; I expect to be paid for my time and trouble.</p>
<p>EDWARD WRIGHT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Dampier. Q. Are you a playing-card maker? - A. Yes, I worked for Lee, No. 42, Fetter-lane.</p>
<p>Q. How many gross of cards did Mr. Lee make a month? - A. From fifteen to sixteen gross a month.</p>
<p>Q. Were all these cards made with aces got from the Stamp-office? - A. No, he might make perhaps a gross a month with aces from the Stamp-office; he used aces of spades that he got elsewhere, that were forged.</p>
<p>JOSEPH REYNOLDS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a card-maker; I worked for Thomas Lee , in Fetter-lane.</p>
<p>Q. What stamps did you use? - A. Stamps that Mr. Lee procured in general; now and then stamps from the Stamp-office.</p>
<p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the difference between a forged stamp and a good one? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. And you were so wicked as to do it? - A. I was only a servant.</p>
<p>Q. Do not you know that a servant is not forced to commit a felony if his master does - were not you taken into custody? - A. I surrendered.</p>
<p>THOMAS ROW sworn. - On the 6th of March I went to Pocock’s, No. 43, Eagle-street, and I took the prisoner into custody with these seven parcels of cards; they appear to be fifty-one; in one parcel the aces are separate; I saw him knock at the door, and I seized him directly.</p>
<p>CHARLES EDWARD BERRESFORD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are Secretary to the Stamp-office? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Do you know from the documents of the Stamp-office when Hart ceased to be a card-maker? - A. I do not know; I have searched the books, and I find his highest number was 80, (looking at the ace of spades found at Thew’s, sold by Maydwell,) they are all forged; they have an imitation of the real ones from the Stamp-office, and these numbers are from 112 to 116.</p>
<p>WILLIAM PRITCHARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am the officer that delivers the legal aces of spades to the different card-makers; the name of the card-maker is inserted on each duty ace; I never deliver the name of one card-maker to another.</p>
<p>Q. Are they constantly delivered in this form, twenty in a sheet? - A. Yes, never in any other way; I knew Hart very well, he ceased card-making on the 13th of November, 1797; he failed, and I was in possession of all his duty aces that were at his manufactory, and I brought them to the Office.</p>
<p>Mr. Alley. Q. You know that a great number had been sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. I do not know that, I have heard so.</p>
<p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Whatever might have been transacted between the Neckinger Mill Company and the Stamp-office, could the Neckinger Mill Company have received forged aces from the Stamp-office? - A. I apprehend not.</p>
<p>Court. Q. Every card-maker has the aces stamped on his paper; his name is likewise inserted on every ace? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. And Lee cannot have Hart’s stamps, and Hart cannot have Lee’s? - A. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Prisoner’s defence. I have always considered them as French cards; I have always bought and sold them as such.</p>
<p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

<p>Mr. Gurney. Q Had you any conversation with the prisoner about this? - A. The last time that I saw Maydwell, before he went out of town.</p>
<p>Q. How long was that before the sixteenth of February? - A. I think that was on the last parcel that I got from Maydwell.</p>

<p>Q. What did you pay for them? - A. Twenty shillings.</p>
<p>Q. Was that the money that he asked for them? - A. I agreed that I would make up for that when I had two dozen more; I was to make it up in the next purchase.</p>
<p>Q. What were you to pay him by the dozen? - A. Twenty-two shillings and sixpence.</p>
<p>Court. Q. For what? - A. A dozen packs; I got them, and parted then with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Fielding Q. On the first of March had you any other transaction with him? - A. I went for the purpose of getting two dozen and two packs.</p>

<p>Q. Upon these different parcels, in what manner were the aces of spades made up? - A. The aces of spades were made up as far as corresponded with the proper number of cards, but made up by themselves.</p>
<p>Q. When was it that you had the conversation with him respecting the cheapness of the cards; was that between the 16th of February and the 1st of March? - A. Yes, it was; we were conversing upon that and other things; upon which he asked me about the cards, whether I knew that they were forged, or whether I thought that they were forged, I cannot say which, it is a very hard thing to swear upon; I answered, no; I think he said, well, but they are; I was very much flurried at the time he mentioned that they were forged; I think that was the word.</p>
<p>Q. You then looked at the ace of spades, you saw the manner it was stamped upon the cards, you observed the name of the card-maker; what stated you to him about the name of Hart? - A. I never mentioned that to him.</p>
<p>Q. When you received your directions from the gentlemen of the Stamp-Office, directing you to purchase cards, did you know any thing of the forgery? - A. I did not know any thing of the forgery, but I suspected it.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I think you told us that you were at Mr. Wheeler’s, a card-maker, are you in his employ? - A. Yes, as clerk, from the beginning of January.</p>
<p>Q. You have had a great deal of knowledge in cards from the beginning of January - Does he deal in a large way? - A. Not very large, equal with others.</p>
<p>Q. You undertook this on purpose of serving Mr. Wheeler, and now you hope, or you are expecting, to serve yourself, how old are you? - A. Nineteen.</p>
<p>Q. A promising youth, the prisoner must have been an old acquaintance of your’s? - A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Not acquainted with him, when Maydwell introduced you to him he was a man that put his life into your hands; there was something so inviting in your face, and you would have us believe, though you went to him twice, and purchased cards of him, that is the story you come here with, and you not being acquainted with him, you had been buying of him, and buying of Maydwell, and you did not know they were forged? - A. I did not know they were forged.</p>
<p>Q. You had bought of him the aces of spades separate from the other cards; you likewise knew what the duty was upon a pack of cards; that it was half a crown a pack; you being conversant with card-making, you knew that the sheets came from the Stamp-office not in this way; that the duty was half a crown a pack, and this came from the Stamp-office in this manner, and was so used by card makers, and put up together, and you did not know that they were forged? - A. I did not know that they were forged.</p>
<p>Q. Did you believe then that the stamp upon the aces of spades that you bought, came from the Stamp-office? - A. I did not believe it; I suspected it to be wrong, I did not positively know that they were forged, I suspected they were wrong.</p>
<p>Q. You suspected there was some fraud, and therefore you could not believe them to come from the Stamp-office? - A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Then I want to know if you did not believe them to be forged, and not to come from the Stamp-office, what third place there was? - A. I could not tell, I suspected them to be forged.</p>
<p>Q. Did you or did you not believe them to be forged? - A. I could not tell, I suspected them to be forged.</p>
<p>Q. Did not you believe them to be forged? - A. I believed (if believing is the same as thinking) them to be forged.</p>
<p>Q. Then if any question was asked you, who was conversant with cards, by this young man, who is rather younger than yourself, did you give him any information on the subject - If he ever asked you how people could afford to sell them so cheap, did you ever give him any information on the subject? - A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever ask him how they could make these cards in France, and afford to sell them so cheap? - A. I have not the least recollection.</p>
<p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. I never did.</p>
<p>Court. Q. You do not recollect that you ever did? - A. No.</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have been telling my friends at my left hand that he took you to Butcherhall-lane - Upon your oath, was not that Maydwell’s lodging, and not the prisoner’s - Will you swear it was his lodging? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was his lodging; the prisoner told me that he kept cards there, and that he had a room for the purpose of keeping them.</p>
<p>Q. Pray was that the same house that you went to with Maydwell? - A. There were two houses, one No. 15, and Mr. Knipe and the people of that house removed to No. 7.</p>
<p>Q. The place that you have described, was that the place where Maydwell lodged? - A. No, Maydwell lodged at No. 6, Lovell’s court, Paternoster-row; Maydwell went and got them from Knipe.</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean to repeat the same thing, that you do not expect any sort of reward for all this? - A. I never expected it from the first; I expect to be paid for my time.</p>
<p>Q. That you heard from my friends speech, I wish I had put you out of Court at the time; then you would have us to believe, that you went for the purpose of bringing Lee to justice; that was what you bought the cards for, not expecting any sort of reward for yourself? - A. Upon my oath, I did not,</p>
<p>Mr. Fielding Q. The first object which you set out with, was to bring Lee to justice? - A. It was.</p>
<p>EDWARD CARTWRIGHT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Dampier. Q. You are an officer? - A. Yes, I apprehended the prisoner on the sixth of March, at the Bull and Mouth, Bull and Mouth street.</p>
<p>Q. Did you search him? - A. Yes, I did.
Q. Did you find any cards in his pocket? - A. None in his pocket; in his box, in his apartment, I found one pack.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What part was it? - A. In a room, in the Bull and Mouth inn; I gave those cards to Mr. Chetham, he was also with me, and I searched in Butcherhall-lane, No. 7; I found some cards there; I produce them; they are in the same state as I found them.</p>
<p>Court. Q. What quantity of cards are there? - A. Nine packs.</p>
<p>Q. Who told you it was his lodgings? - A. When I took the prisoner he took me to his lodgings with Mr. Chetham.</p>
<p>Mr. Dampier. Q. Were there any duty aces with these cards? - A. None in these nine.</p>
<p>JAMES CHETHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
<p>Q. Did you go with the last witness to the prisoner’s lodging? - A. Yes, I did, and to his lodging-room at the Bull and Mouth inn.</p>
<p>Q. The prisoner was the book-keeper at the Bull and Mouth inn? - A. He was one of the book-keepers in the coach-office.</p>
<p>Q. Did the last witness give you any thing when you were there? - A. I was present when the box was opened; I asked him whether that was his box; he said it was; I then desired the officer to search it; Cartwright searched it, and found one pack of cards, and he delivered them to me; these are the cards, I have had them ever since in my possession; I marked the ace of spades with my initials.</p>
<p>Q. (To Mr. Beresford.) This impression was made at your office, from a plate prepared by the authority of the Commissioners, for Hart, the card-maker, and look at the other aces produced by Thew, what is the number upon that? - A. No. 116.</p>
<p>Q. Have you searched the documents of your office? - A. Yes, and I find no one higher than 80.</p>
<p>Q.(To Mr. Merchant) Will you look at the first parcel which Thew produced? - A The numbers are all higher than 80; they are from 112 to 116.</p>
<p>Q. Do they appear to be a general imitation, and to have a general resemblance of the genuine one; you are the engraver at the Stamp-office? - A. Yes, they are in imitation.</p>
<p>Q Look at that Mr. Chetham found? - A. They are all forgeries.</p>
<p>Q. What numbers do you find upon these? - A. They are all higher than 80; they are from 112 to 116.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PRITCHARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the overseer, you deliver out these things to the card-makers? - A. I am.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Q. Did you know a card-maker of the name of Hart? - A. Very well.</p>
<p>Q. For a considerable while have you delivered out any in his name? - A. None since the year 1797.</p>
<p>Q. I do not know whether you know of your own knowledge how high his number went? - A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Is that from the Stamp-office? - A. I have no hesitation to say it is forged.</p>
<p>Q. The plates are delivered to the makers whose name they bear? - A. Always.</p>
<p>Q. So that the plates of Lee would not be delivered to Hart, nor the plates of Hart to Lee? - A. No, they have been delivered by me for a great number of years, and I never delivered one to the name of another card-maker.</p>
<p>Prisoner’s defence. Thew was introduced to me as a mere stranger by Maydwell; I should have been very imprudent to have told a person I had never seen before that the cards I sold were forged; I never acknowledged to any person that they were forged, because I never knew it.</p>
<p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

<h2>The Trial of John Blacklin<a class="headerlink" href="#the-trial-of-john-blacklin" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The court, it seems, had accepted that the young men tried for selling the cards, and whose case had been heard <em>after</em> Blacklin’s, had naively believed they were selling smuggled French cards.</p>
<p>So what had transpired in that previous case, as presented to the court the day before?</p>
<p>The indictment was primarily for feloniously uttering playing cards with conterfeited stamp duty marks. The case opened with a Mr Thomas Boddington, in whose apartments many packs of playing cards, and separate aces, had been found by John Rivett. Boddington explained how he had bought 36 dozen packs of cards, stamped with the name of <em>Hart</em> but omitting a separate duty stamp, for a little over a shilling each, receiving the aces separately, sometimes delivered by a ten year-old boy named Matthew Foy. Boddington then resold the packs, still with separate aces, to others, including a Mr. Buggin and a Mr. Spyers, the latter having introduced him to Blacklin. Buggin in turn had sold some of the cards on to Isaac Maydwell. The low cost was allegedly a result of using coarse paper mixed with “the clippings or clickings of the best”. Omn the same day, Rivett and John Read, an officer of the City, searched Blacklin’s house, where more packs of cards were found, again lacking aces. Foy, and another lad, 14 year old Thomas Connelly, were both errand-boys in Blacklin’s house and ran packages from Blacklin to Boddington. When Foy was questioned, he was asked if he knew his catechism, asked if he knew what an oath was, asked if he knew where he would go after he died if he told a lie: “Yes, to hell”. In terms of manufacture, Edward Wright and Joseph Reynolds were cardmakers who worked for a Mr Lee, who had absconded, who supplied cards to Blacklin. Cards were delivered from Lee to Blacklin in packs with a simple white unstamped wrapper, not including aces, the aces being supplied separately. Wright had worked cards up with sheets of aces legally obtained from the Stamp Office at 20 to a sheet and the name of the card maker on them. But they produced other sheets for Lee, with only 10 aces per sheet, with the name of <em>Hart</em> on them, a card-maker who had stopped working 7 years previously. Seventy-two year old Nathaniel Merchant, an Inspector at the Stamp Office with four years standing, identified the aces marked as <em>Hart</em> were forged based on inconsistent plate numbers. Charles-Edward Berresfoprd, secretary to the Stamp-Office, had checked the order books to see if plate numbers corresponding the numbers on Blacklin’s aces were assigned to Hart, but he had not checked the original warrants awarded to the original engraver. Blacklin’s defence was that he believed the aces had been brought from abroad, and was then informed they had been purchased as waste paper by the Neckinger Mill Company from Somerset-House. Mr. Searjeant Best, for the defence, then asked for certain of the counts against Blacklin to be read out, then claiming they did not apply in the present case, because Blackling had not vended fradulently stamped cards and wrappers: his were unstamped. Mr Gleed then argued that the epithet <em>playing cards</em> refers to full packs of cards; but as Blacklin didn’t sell full packs, he wasn’t vending forged playing cards, just parcels of 51 cards. The prosecution denined the latter by saying the bargain had been struck for packs of cards, not separae purchases of parcels of 51 cards, and separatley packaged aces.</p>

<p>Q. Do you know whether at that time the prisoner’s orders were unexecuted for want of the aces? - A. He told me so; that he wanted aces of spades, and he could not execute the orders because he had not the aces to put to them; and the orders he had delivered they would not give him the money for them till he had furnished the aces of spades; I told him not to blame my master for it, as the man who had the doing of it had disappointed him.</p>
<p>Q. Give us your very expression as you used in your conversation with him at that time, or any other time about a plate? - A. I do not recollect that I told him any thing about a plate; no more than what I have observed to the man that had the doing of it.</p>
<p>Q. The aces that are furnished when the duties are regularly paid are obtained at the Stamp-Office, are they not? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. So that no man, except the person employed by the Stamp-Office, have any thing to do with them till they are delivered to the card-maker? - A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Are these regularly and immediately furnished upon application at the Office? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. The duty aces which are delivered from the Stamp-Office, do not they always contain the card-maker’s name? - A. Always.</p>
<p>Q. Therefore any that had been issued from the Stamp-Office, your master would have had his name upon them? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. I observe that these you have produced, as manufactured at Lee’s, have the name of Hart upon them - Was there any maker at the time you were employed by Lee, of the name of Hart, that you were acquainted with? - A. No, none at all.</p>
<p>Q. Are you pretty well acquainted with the makers in town? - A. Yes, I know them.</p>
<p>Q. And I suppose you have worked for many of them - Did you know Hart when he was in the trade? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Do you know how long ago it is since he left off? - A. I believe about seven years.</p>
<p>Q. So that if he had been in the trade, it is probable you should have known it? - A. I certainly should.</p>
<p>Q. When the prisoner visited Lee’s house occasionally, did he come where you passed? - A. We pasted backwards, he very seldom came there, he was sometimes there.</p>
<p>Q. He came sometimes there, while you were actually pasting these plates, which are half the size of the legal plates? - A. I do not recollect seeing him there while we were in the act of doing it.</p>
<p>Q. What price did he pay Lee for the cards he had bought of him? - A. I do not rightly know.</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Blacklin about it? - A. I have heard Blacklin say that my master charged him too much.</p>
<p>Q. Do you happen to know from Blacklin himself what his selling price was, when he was stating to you that your master charged him too much for them - Do you know what he sold them at himself? - A. No.</p>
<p>JOSEPH REYNOLDS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Are you a card-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Did you work for Lee? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Blacklin? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Was he a customer of Lee’s? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Did he deal to a large amount? - A. Yes, he used to be one of Mr. Lee’s principal customers.</p>
<p>Q. How many gross a month did Lee make? - A. I suppose about thirteen or fourteen gross per month.</p>
<p>Q. I do not know whether you happen to know what the duty would be, if they were bought at the Stamp-Office? - A. Half a crown a pack.</p>
<p>Q. And he would make about thirteen gross per month. -</p>
<p>Mr. Gibbs. Three thousand two hundred and forty-two pounds a year, and more than that.</p>
<p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Did Mr. Lee use some legal stamps? - A. He did.</p>
<p>Q. Did he use some that were not legal stamps? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. What proportion did one bear to another? - A. He very seldom used more than one hundred and forty packs per month.</p>
<p>Q. And the prisoner was his principal customer? - A. Latterly he was.</p>
<p>Q. Were they upon the footing of intimacy? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Upon some occasion you supped together with him? - A. I did, in Christmas week.</p>
<p>Q. You and Lee supped at Blacklin’s house with him? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Were those sheets in the name of Hart, the sheets that you used to work up for the greatest part of your trade? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
<p>Q. This is from the same impression? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Were all sold to the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Blacklin, made with these aces? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. What we call, at the present, forged aces? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. From your own knowledge of aces do you know whether these are legal or forged? - A. They are not legal, they are forged.</p>
<p>Q. And all that Lee sold to Blacklin were of that manufactory? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Are not the cards, with the card denoting the stamp-duty of the card-maker, generally issued in this form, with the paper stamp on the wrapper? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. He is bound to do it under a penalty, and indeed a man buying them, without that, subjects himself to a penalty - Were any of these cards that were sold by Lee to Blacklin issued in this form? - A. I never saw any.</p>
<p>Q. Look at these - Is that the form in which they were always delivered? - A. Yes, in a white wrapper.</p>
<p>Q. Were the aces of spades delivered in that wrapper, or in separate parcels? - A. Always in separate parcels by themselves.</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner complain at any time, either in, or not in, Lee’s presence, that his orders were not executed speedy enough? - A. Never before me.</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever any conversation before you on that subject? - A. Never.</p>
<p>NATHANIEL MERCHANT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the Inspector of the Stamp-Office? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. How old are you, sir? - A. Seventy-two.</p>
<p>Q. Just look at that thirty-six dozen and the corresponding aces (Lee’s aces) that were found at Boddington’s? - A. There are seventy-two, and each corresponds to the thirty-six dozen.</p>
<p>Q. For what number of years have you been an Inspector? - A. About four years.</p>
<p>Q. From inspecting these aces, are you able to say whether they are from any instrument issued at the Stamp-Office? - A. They certainly did not come from the Stamp-Office.</p>
<p>Court. Q. What aces are they? - A.(Mr. Fielding.) Part of the parcel marked B. containing seventy-two aces, being part of what was found at Boddington’s.</p>
<p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look them all over, Mr. Merchant; are you enabled to say what they are? - A. They are all of them forged, Mr. Hart has not gone beyond the number 80; I mean, there has been, I believe, no aces issued from the Stamp-Office, in the name of Hart, beyond the number of 80; these are 112, 113, 114, 115, and 116.</p>
<p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. Genuine ones, in the name of Hart, never exceeded the number 80.</p>
<p>Q. What are the other seven aces found at Boddington’s? - A. They are all a forgery, and they are from the same plate, and the same numbers, from 112 to 116.</p>
<p>Q. The paper 8, containing 59 aces of spades, what are they? - A. These are the same, and appear from the same impression, and contain the same number; the paper marked B contains six aces, they are forged; and the plate E is a forgery, containing fifty-four aces: they appear to be from the same plate.</p>
<p>Q. The one that was in the pocket-book of the prisoner, the ace of spades which the officer took out of the pocket-book, which was in his pocket and on his person, look at that, and tell me whether that is a forgery; it is in the name of Hart? - A. It is the same, and marked 112, a higher number than Hart ever had.</p>
<p>Mr. Garrow. Q. We now shew him the two papers marked Edward Wright , which Wright said he brought from Mr. Lee’s manufactory - Do these appear to you to be a forgery, and to resemble those you have already looked at in these cards? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Are they imitations, and do they bear resemblance to those which were issued by the Stamp-Office? - A. Certainly they are an imitation of those which were issued by the Stamp-Office while Hart was in the trade, but the numbers do not agree.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Were you engraver at the Stamp-Office at that time? - A. No, I have examined the books, I find none higher than 80, and I have heard from my predecessor.</p>
<p>Q. You do not know that of your own knowledge; your only reason for believing these are forgeries is there are higher numbers, which somebody has told you are higher than Hart ever had? - A. Certainly these numbers do not correspond with the numbers belonging to Hart at the Stamp-Office.</p>
<p>Q. You do not know, you not being engraver at the Stamp-Office at that time; there may be other plates besides those which you have seen. -</p>
<p>Mr. Garrow. Q. I now shew him a genuine plate, a sheet containing twenty impressions, with the name of Hart on them; look at that and look at the ten; and look whether those of the ten, found at Lee’s with the name of Hart - Do they appear to be made with a view to imitate them? - A. They are done to imitate.</p>
<p>Q. From your inspection of the legal one of twenty, and the other of ten impressions on Lee’s paper, do they appear to be done with imitation of the genuine plates issued by the Stamp-Office? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>CHARLES-EDWARD BERRESFORD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are Secretary to the Stamp-Office, you have been so sometime? - A. From the year 1801.</p>
<p>Q. Before that time you were Deputy Secretary? - A. Yes, and I was First Clerk for a great many years.</p>
<p>Q. And you are conversant with the business I take it for granted? - A. Yes; the aces are issued from the plates in sheets.</p>
<p>Q. How many in a sheet? - A. There are twenty in a sheet.</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember the time when Hart was card-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Look at this sheet, and tell me whether this sheet is from the plate engraved for Hart? - A. It is the same as was used by Hart.</p>
<p>Q. Have you searched the office books, to see how high Hart’s numbers went? - A. I have, I do not find that they went higher than 80.</p>
<p>Q. If they had gone higher than 80, must not you have found it in your search? - A. From the search I do not find any above 80, and I have searched with all the diligence I can.</p>
<p>Q. Is the person who was engraver at the time Hart was a maker living or dead? - A. Dead.</p>
<p>Q. Mr. Merchant succeeded him? - A. Mr. Merchant was his assistant for some time, and afterwards succeeded him.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You say probably there may be numbers above 80? - A. I cannot say whether there are or not.</p>
<p>Court. Q. You have said you searched? - A. Yes, I cannot find any above 80; I cannot say any thing respecting the cards.</p>
<p>Q. Have you searched the Stamp-Office with your best diligence, to find whether there are any above 80? - A. I find none beyond 80, there is no record beyond 80.</p>
<p>Q. Have you searched any of the warrants? - A. I have only searched the books.</p>
<p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. They are regularly entered in the book? - A. They are.</p>
<p>Q. You find no entry beyond 80? - A. I have not.</p>
<p>Q. If there had been must not you have found them in your searching? - A. I think so; I have gone from 1765 up to 1800; I have searched all that period, and there are none higher than 80.</p>
<p>Q. You do not believe there are any higher than 80? - A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Have you any reason to believe or suspect there are any beyond 80? - A. No.</p>
<p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You said you had not got the warrants of the Commissioners of the Office, to see if there were any plates ordered beyond 80; you have not been furnished with these warrants? - A. No.</p>
<p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Would not those warrants have enabled you to make a better search; what do you mean by not having the warrants? - A. I have only examined the entry of the order-book.</p>
<p>Q. The entry in the order-book is a transcript of the warrants? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. What book have you examined? - A. Only the order-book.</p>
<p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear that there are no higher numbers? - A. To the best of my belief there are no higher numbers than 80.</p>
<p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. The person to whom the warrants were delivered was the engraver you know? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Whenever there is a warrant of that sort made, there is an entry made of the order, and a specimen of the stamp afterwards taken; you have seen no entry beyond 80? - A. No.</p>
<p>Court. Q. The person to whom this warrant is given is the engraver, and the order of that engraving is entered in the book, and you have searched that book? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. And when the engraving is made there is an impression taken from it and kept? - A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. And you find no order of the engraving, nor any impression? - A. There is no order of engraving, nor any impression in that book.</p>
<p>JAMES CHETHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Where did you find that account? - A. In the prisoner’s accompt book.</p>
<p>Q. This is Boddington’s account, called waste paper; this you found at the prisoner’s house? - A. I did. After his books were brought to Bow-street I examined them in the presence of the Magistrate, and in the presence of the defendant.</p>
<p>Court. Q. Whose book is this? - A. (Mr. Garrow.) The prisoner’s, which Rivett has spoken of.</p>
<p>Mr. Chetham. I found this accompt in the green book, in the ledger.</p>
<p>Mr. Garrow. This is the accompt which Boddington said he wrote, stating the transaction between him and the prisoner, and found in the ledger.</p>
<p>(Read in Court.) Dtr. Mr. Blacklin with T. Boddington. - On the debtor side is cash, 5 l. - 26 draft, 24 l. 16 s. - 8 pans - 17 draft, Mr. Seck, 21 l. On creditor side, Jan. 16, ban, one cants. of Co. - February 3d, 10 compts, 4 yellows, 28 l. 13 s. one pans, 2 l. 2 s. - 36 dozen, W. P. in red ink - 14 with a stroke, 25 l. 4 s. - and two books, 5 s. The whole of that 36 dozen is in red ink, except the sum, the 14 with a stroke is with red ink, and all this carried out with a stroke in common ink.</p>
<p>Mr. Garrow. I will just shew one of the forged cards; you will see the forged card has not the additional duty at the bottom; at the bottom of the forged card there is nothing but the word Hart; on the legal one there is the word additional duty.</p>
<p>Prisoner’s defence. At the time that I received these cards, I did not know that there were any aces of spades that were forged, I understood that they were foreign cards brought from abroad; I shortly after was informed that a large quantity of waste paper had been sold to the Neckinger Mill Company about two years ago, and which I have always since understood; the Neckinger Mill Company purchased at Somerset-house these aces amongst the quantities of waste paper which they purchased at Somerset-house.</p>
<p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q.(To Mr. Shelton.) Will you have the goodness to read the 1st and 7th Counts. - (Read in Court.)</p>
<p>The Jurors upon their oath present, that John Blacklin , on the 26th of February, in the 45th year of his present Majesty’s reign, with force and arms, feloniously did utter certain playing cards, liable to a stamp duty, with counterfeit marks thereon, counterfeiting and resembling the impression of certain marks directed to be used by virtue of a certain Act of Parliament, made in the 29th year of our Sovereign Lord the King, and several former Acts of Parliament, purposely denoting the duties granted to his Majesty on cards, made fit for sale, and used in Great Britain; that he, the said John Blacklin , on the 26th of February as aforesaid, feloniously did utter playing cards with such counterfeited marks thereon, he knowing the said counterfeited marks to be forged.</p>
<p>The said Jurors present, that the said John Blacklin , on the 26th of February, in the 45th year aforesaid, did feloniously vend and sell divers playing cards, liable to a stamp duty, with counterfeited marks on the spotted side of the said cards, counterfeiting an impression of certain marks directed to be used by a certain Act of Parliament, made at Westminster, in the 29th year of his Majesty’s reign, entitled an Act for granting to his Majesty several additional stamp duties on cards and dice, and several former Acts of Parliament, relating to cards made fit for sale in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Mr. Serjeant Best. I take this to be the most convenient time to state my objections, and to make an arrest of judgment, if the case should require it, as it does not appear to me that this offence is particularly described by either of these Counts.</p>
<p>The evidence that we have heard does not prove any offence within this Act of Parliament upon which this indictment is framed, the 29th of George the Third; the words are, that if any person shall counterfeit, or forge, or procure to be forged or counterfeited, or vend and sell any stamp or mark to be used relating to cards, dice, or newspapers, or shall counterfeit or resemble the same, with such counterfeit marks thereon, knowing the same to be counterfeited, shall be guilty of felony.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will see that they are, by another Act of Parliament, directed to apply this stamp not upon any of the cards, but upon the wrapper; the statute I allude to is the 9th of Ann, chap. 28, sect. 41, there the Commissioners are directed to put this stamp on the wrapper of these cards. I submit to your Lordship, it may be said that subsequent Acts of Parliament have added additional duties, still if the original statute of Ann is not repealed, whatever number of duties may be added, the stamp must be in the same place, and in the same manner, as it is pointed out by the said Act of Parliament; and any stamp put in any other manner, is a stamp which the Commissioners are not authorized to put on. I submit to your Lordship, as it appears to me, this man did not vend any of these stamps upon wrappers, nor any stamp upon cards, and if the Commissioners are authorized, by any subsequent Act of Parliament, to put the stamp upon a particular card, then this indictment has not made out the case, because this indictment is not for the offence of putting the stamp upon a particular card. I desired these two Counts to be read, and your Lordship will find that it is both uttering and vending stamps, not upon a particular card, but stamps upon playing cards.</p>
<p>Mr. Gleed. If I understand the meaning of the word cards right, it must be a perfect pack of cards; the uttering of any one card would not be a felony within the meaning of this Act of Parliament, but by making use of the word playing cards. We must likewise see what the Legislature thought proper to impose upon selling such cards. The duty has been imposed upon a pack of playing cards, it is so stated upon the face of this indictment to be playing cards, and the evidence has been, in this case, of uttering cards without the aces of spades. The cards, without the aces of spades, cannot be considered as playing cards, nor can the ace of spades sold by itself at any time be said to be playing cards. In all cases of forgery, it is necessary that the forged instrument should be in all parts the similitude of the true; in this case there arises an objection, namely, it does not appear to be a pack of cards within the meaning of the words in this Act of Parliament, nor is it that which upon the face of the indictment it charges the prisoner with. It charges the prisoner with uttering, vending, and selling playing cards, when, in point of fact, the only evidence that has been introduced on the part of the prosecution have only supported the sale of a parcel of fifty-one cards, and not a pack of cards.</p>
<p>Mr. Solicitor General. It has been stated to your Lordship, that we cannot possibly support this indictment that charges the prisoner with having sold cards with counterfeit stamps, which must mean a counterfeit stamp on the wrapper; for the learned Serjeant says there is no Act justifies any stamp upon these cards. The 9th of Ann, which directs stamps to be put on the wrapper, which is true, but my answer is a positive denial on the fact, from subsequent Acts of Parliament on the case, which he had either forgotten or omitted. The 10th of Ann, chap. 19, sect. 162, it is enacted, that on one card in each pack shall be marked on the spotted side thereof. Your Lordship will go to the 5th of George the Third, chap. 46, sect. 9, which I do not find to be repealed, it there directs the Commissioners to provide a new stamp for the wrapper. No, for the ace of spades, and to make distinction between those meant for home consumption and those for exportation, and then it directs that which has always been observed by the Stamp Office, and which they have been studiously attentive to, that one of the sixpenny duties shall be denoted on the wrapper, and another also is directed to be put on the wrapper, and one of these sixpenny duties is also directed to be denoted on the ace of spades. I am not sure that any former Act mentions the ace of spades, but the 10th of Ann having directed it to be on the spotted side of one of the cards, and practice has continued it on the ace of spades. The next argument that fell from a learned friend of mine was, that the Act which prohibits the selling of playing cards with counterfeit stamps, must mean to prohibit vending packs of cards with counterfeit stamps, and that there is no evidence in this case of the vending a pack of cards, only a parcel of fifty-one, and that therefore this case is not within the Act. Certainly, without deviating from the indulgence which is permitted to the Counsel of a prisoner, I might have interrupted him when he was addressing your Lordship, though in fact he was addressing the Jury, when he was stating that there was not sufficient evidence to go to a Jury. Your Lordship will see there is not only evidence, but decisive evidence, and the fact is most certain, that the packs are sold in this way: - If I was to sell a dozen, containing each fifty-one in one parcel, and I sell another parcel containing twelve aces of spades, which two parcels together make twelve packs, if it was necessary to prove his selling these cards, and delivering them in this way, there is no doubt from the evidence. In the first place, do they bargain for cards containing each fifty-one? No; they bargain for a gross, or packs of cards; what or how much a dozen, for what is a dozen parcels of cards without the aces of spades? No, they include the aces of spades, there is no additional price for the aces of spades that these people were to pay, I will prove it by Boddington, who bought thirty-six dozen, and the evidence has said they would not pay for the cards, they would not pay the man till he had sent out the aces of spades. It is beyond all possibility of a doubt that the prisoner not only sold, but actually delivered packs of cards, and that it is proved beyond all possibility of a doubt or hesitation, that there were all these packs of cards not only sold, but a specific price to be given for each pack.</p>
<p>Court. I consider it as an offence undoubtedly upon which the Revenue has been defrauded in the strictest sense of the words of the Act of Parliament, that is on record, because there are fifty-one in one parcel, and one in another, which made up the pack of cards.</p>
<p>Jury. Q.(To the Secretary of the Stamp Office.) Whether you know of any cards being sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. There were some sold, but I do not know to whom.</p>
<p>Court. Q.(To Mr. Solicitor of the Stamp Office.) Do you know of any being sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. A society of gentlemen proposed to convert old paper into new, they applied to Government for authority to purchase the waste paper at the Stamp Office, and Government conceiving it was for the benefit of the public, the Commissioners were directed to sell their waste paper for the purpose of being converted into new paper, consequently the Commissioners did dispose of a great quantity of waste paper, amongst which there were cancelled aces of spades, which were brought from the card-makers, with the corners cut off; the Company, at the same time, giving this most positive assurance, that the paper would be immediately plunged into the caldron, and at once destroyed; this Company and manufactory failed, they did not perform their engagement by destroying this waste paper, they afterwards advertised their stock to be sold, and amongst the other things the aces of spades were sold cancelled, and with the corners cut off.</p>
<p>Court. Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that all the aces of spades that they sold the corners were cut off? - A. Mr. Lee applied with a feigned name, they were not sold in sheets, I cannot speak to that.</p>
<p>Prisoner. Mr. Robey, the auctioneer, sold these goods for the Neckinger Mill Company; I gave my attorney yesterday evening some aces of spades which Mr. Lee had purchased of the Neckinger Mill Company, he purchased vast quantities, and my attorney has some of the aces without the corners being cut off; I have been informed that they sold a vast quantity which originally came from Somerset-house.</p>
<p>Court. Gentlemen, you are to understand that they waited for the aces of spades while they were engraving the plate, therefore this could not be from that.</p>
<p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

<p>OLD BAILEY. Yesterday, Blacklin, who was convicted of uttering a forged stamp on the ace of spades, was again placed in the Dock; Mr. SERGEANT BEST having, at his trial, suggested that, should he be convicted, he would submit to the Court an Arrest of Judgment on the informality of the indictment. Mr. GLEED, yesterday, supported the plea in favour of the Prisoner; and his arguments were replied to by Messrs. FIELDING, DAMPIER, and KNAPP, Counsel for the Crown. The RECORDER, however, did not deem it proper to decide on a point which involved the death of an individual, and the matter was consequently reserved for the opinion of the Twelve Judges. The judgment will of course be respited.</p>

<p>Morning Herald (London) - Wednesday 01 May 1805</p>
<p>OLD BAILEY. Monday.</p>
<p><em>John Blacklin</em>  was indicted for feloniouly uttering and vending certain cards, with a forged or counterfeit stamp.—It was proved that the prisoner purchased considerable quantities of cards from a person named Lee, a Card-maker in Fetter-lane, - and resold them. The cards were made up in packs, without the Ace of Spades, on which the stamp is placed, that card being always delivered separately. The forged stamp had the name Hart on it, and it appeared from the evidence, that no stamps had been issued from the Stamp-Office to that maker, bearing numbers higher than 80; whereas the numbers on the counterfeit stamps found in the possession of the prisoner, or sold by him, were 112, 113, 114; 115, and 116.</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeant Best stated an objection, founded on the Act of the 9th of Queen Ann, which requires the duties to be expressed on the wrapper; and contended that the subsequent Acts which mentioned the Ace of Spades, were only intended to distinguish between cards for exportation and those for home consumption.— Mr. CONST and Mr. GLEAD followed on the same side. The latter Gentleman maintained, that as there were only 51 cards in each pack, the article charged by the indictment to be forged was imperfect, and therefore did not come within the meaning of the Act.— These objections were replied to by the SOLICITOR-GENERAL and Mr. GARROW, and , finally, over ruled by the Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron THOMPSON charged the Jury, who returned a verdict of <em>Guilty</em>, but recommended him to mercy, on account of his previous good character.</p>

<p>John Blacklin, who was convictcd in the former part of the Session, for uttering forged stamps cards, was yesterday placed at the bar, an arrest of judgment having been suggested on his trial by Mr. Sergeant Best, in an objection to the form of the indictment. Mr. Gleed supported the plea in favour of the prisoner, and his arguments were replied to by Messrs. Fielding, Dampier, and Knapp, Counsel for the Crown. The Recorder, however, not feeling it his duty to decide the point, arrested judgment until the matter should be decided by the Twelve Judges.</p>

<p>COURT OF KING’S BENCH, WESTMINSTER, MAY 14</p>
<p>The judges rose at an early hour, and proceeded to the Exchequer-chamber, to hear the argument on the reserved case of the man convicted of forging the Ace of Spades.</p>

Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser - Monday 20 May 1805</p>
<p>COURT OF EXCHEQUER. SATURDAY, May 18. Three persons were brought up for judgment under several convictions at country Assizes, for obstructing and assaulting the Revenue Officers in the execution of their duty, and were sentenced, on motion of the Solicitor-General, to several periods of imprisonmet.</p>
<p>At eleven o’clock, the Judges retired into the Inner Chamber, where they heard Mr. Sergeant Best and Mr. Glead in behalf of the arrest of judgment in the case of Blacklin, convicted for forging the Ace of Spades.</p>
</div>
<p>Blacklin it seems, got off lightly. I found no record of his execution, and we might assume he received a lesser sentence on account of his previous good character, or had the verdict quashed based on the appeals of Best and Gleed.</p>
<p>As well as the fraudsters, it seems that the smaller fry of people reselling forged cards may also have been getting caught up by the policing operations elsewhere:</p>

<p>On Saturday, …. The same day, <em>V. Rumley</em>, a Calico Glazier, and <em>——— Irvine</em>, a Baker, were examined at Union Hall, for selling packs of cards with forged Aces of Spades, when the former turned King’s evidence, and the latter was fully committed.</p>

<p>But there were also bigger fish to catch. Such as Richard Harding. And he would not to be as lucky as Blacklin.</p>
