# Reaffirming the Law with Regard to Stamp Duty, 1804

Ever since the time of Queen Anne, in the early seventeen hundreds, the Ace of Spades was, quite literally, a marked card, required to bear an official mark.

Stamp duty, a tax on every pack of playing cards, was levied on the wrapper that sealed each new pack of cards, and a stamp on the ace showed that the duty had been paid on that pack.

Originally applied as a hand stamp, from the mid-1700s the Ace of Spades in each pack was separately printed by the official Stamp Office. Card makers printed 51 cards of the deck, but had to purchase the Duty Ace from the Stamp Office. The intricate design of the Ace of Spades stems from this period: it was an anti-fraud device. The card also include a plate number and the name of the maker. Only an official ace was allowed in a pack, and any printer fraudulently publishing the ace of spades card could be punished severely for it.

Very severely. In an Act of Parliament of 1804 updating stamp duty across a range of items, the act of defrauding the monarch by forging stamps used to identify duty as having been paid was reaffirmed to be a felony. Which is to say, if you were convicted, then you could expect to receive a death penalty.

```{admonition} Benefit of Clergy
:class: seealso

If you read through old statutes, you are often likely to come across the phrase "without benefit of clergy" applied to to way in which certain offences are to be judged.

This refers to an old tradition whereby members of the clergy was allowed to submit themselves to the mercy of an ecclesiastical court, in a trial held under canon law, rather than a civil or King's court.
