# Old Frizzle

With the number of capital crimes increasing, there came a point when Parliament started to think again about the effectiveness of such penalties. For example, in the matter of forgery, MPs were to debated the *Forgery Punishment Mitigation Bill* in late May and early June, 1821, although no mention is made in the debates regarding playing cards or the forging of the ace of spades. The bill was lost in division, where the Ayes were 115, and the Noes, 121.

With a large number of offences attracting a mandatory death sentence, the *Judgement of Death Act*, 1823, allowed judges to commute the death penalty to a lesser sentence, except in cases of treason and murder.

However, when the law regarding playing cards and dice was consolidated in 1828, the capital sentence was still there as the default option for forging the Ace of Spades ([pp41-42](https://archive.org/details/statutesunitedk07britgoog/page/n68/mode/1up)).

```

With the 1828 act, the duty was redudced from 2s6d to 1s. Card makers were now obliged to provide paper to the Stamp Office on which would be printed the Ace of Spades, the only source for this particular card. Popularly referred to as "Old Frizzle", this Duty Ace had and intricate design, inspired by the complex "anti-fraud" design applied to bank notes.

Four years later, in 1832, the various crimes of forgery to which the capital sentence applied were combined into a single act.
