*Many stories are situated in a particular place. Here is a Church I really must try to visit, to see if I can get a glimpse of the playing card that is described as being carved into the south face of the tower. And to ask some locals if they can tell me the tale of it...*

PLAYING CARDS ON A CHURCH TOWER (9th S. iii. 90). â€” The curious opening in the south face of the fourteenth-century tower of Little Wittenham Church, Berks, certainly bears a strong resemblance to the ace of spades, and local tradition has attached to this architectural vagary a legend which attributes the erection of the tower to a lucky game of cards, in which that particular card brought a large sum to a gambler, who devoted a portion to the church, marking his gift with this leaf from the 'Devil's Picture - Book.' No other cards are represented on this tower so far as I know ; the opening in the west face, which might be taken for the ace of clubs, is only the ordinary " cross arrow-slit " form usual at that date.
